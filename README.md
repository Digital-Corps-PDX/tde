# Trust & Decision Engineering

A research and teaching practice rooted at the University of Michigan  
Supported by State Capacity AI

Trust & Decision Engineering studies how public decisions move through institutional systems and how those systems shape outcomes across civic infrastructure, care systems, and public service delivery.

Public decisions travel through policy, software, interpretation, and administrative process. These layers form the civil stack. The lab maps these layers and studies how authority moves through them.

## Focus

Decision infrastructure  
Care and delivery systems  
Judgment routing  
Automated authority  
Trust and institutional legitimacy
